# Employee-Management-in-Reactive-Request-Programming-
A Spring WebFlux application developed in Employee Management System.

## Motivation:-
In my past projects, I have been using traditional request programming. What is this means the thread will wait until it has been processed without taking another request. So by this process lot of resources will be wasted. So to optimize it this project uses a reactive programming request model in which the thread won't wait for any request to be completed by db it will simultaneously hold another request as well.< br/>
